    + For the record here a list of the deleted files:

      (needed for cli.make)

    + Added dpatch to build-dependencies.
    + Added myself to uploaders.
    + Fixed usage of the ".NET" term in package descriptions.
    + Moved conflicts libununit-cil to replaces, as it only overwrites the

    + Include /usr/share/cli-common/cli.make

      disable the fit test-fixtures.

    + Enable creating XML documentation for the nunit.core library
      (needed for monodoc API docs).
